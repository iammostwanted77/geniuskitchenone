<h3>Mike&#39;s Upstanding Deviled Eggs instructions</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Use older, larger eggs. They peel much easier than newer eggs..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			If any egg floats, throw it away. It&#39;s bad..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place 18 eggs in a large pot and fill with water 1 1/2&#34;to 2&#34; above the eggs..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			You&#39;ll only need 14 eggs. The additional 4 are just in case you accidently split any egg bodies open, any eggs are rotten or you require additional yolks for thickening..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Turn on heat and bring water and eggs to a rapid boil. Do not add salt to your water..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once water is at a full boil, turn off heat and let eggs sit in hot water with a tight lid on it for 18 minutes undisturbed..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Begin mixing your filler ingredients. Add everything except for those specifically listed as garnishments in a bowl and mix together..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once eggs are fully boiled, pull from stove, drain eggs and rinse eggs and pot with cold water to cool off pot. Immediately fill pot with ice and ice cold water. This action is important and two part. #1: You&#39;re stopping the cooking process and #2: You&#39;re helping your eggs to peel even easier..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Carefully peel all eggs by gently tapping the wide end [this is where air pockets will be if there are any] and tip [skinny end] of the egg to a hard surface then gently roll the egg with slight pressure to loosen its shell. Begin peeling egg from the base or wide bottom side. Rinse peeled eggs in cold water to remove any shells..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pat eggs dry with a paper towel..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			With a sharp knife, gently shave off a sliver at the wider base of all the eggs. Just enough to make the eggs stand upright and evenly on their own..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now, cleanly cut 1/3 of the eggs tops off and carefully reserve them on a seperate plate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Gently dig out the yolks with a small spoon or the thin handle of a small spoon and place in mixing bowl. Be careful not to split the egg bodies open and to remove all of the yolk. I wrap my fingers fully around the eggs body to keep from splitting the egg walls while retrieving the yolk. If you still see yellow in the cavity, there&#39;s still yolk in there and probably a lot of it..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Clean up your egg bodies with a moist paper towel place all of your empty boiled eggs in a serving tray standing upright. Make certain they are leveled straight up. If not, simply shave another slight sliver off until the egg stands completely even..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Using a potato masher, mash yolks into your mixture. When completed, mix together with a spoon and taste test. You may personally prefer additional mustard, relish, salt, pepper, etc,. It&#39;s entirely up to you!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Using a large Ziplock bag, spoon all of your yolk mixture into one corner of the bag. Squeeze out the air and force everything into that corner. Your Ziplock bag should now look like a frosting piping bag. Using scissors, slightly snip off the bottom of the corner of the bag so your contents can exit the bag and fill your egg cavities..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Fill each one of your empty egg yolk cavities with your mixture to the top of the cavity. After each are flush with the top, top them off with more yolk filling until they&#39;re a bit overstuffed. By doing this you&#39;ll make certain each egg has equal amounts of filling. You may have more filling than you need. If so, feel free to use your additional 4 eggs and repeat your process with those..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Authors Note: You may not think you have enough yolk filling to fill all the egg cavities but you most likely do. The cavities are fairly small. However, if you&#39;re somewhat confident you&#39;ll need more, just add a few more spoonfuls of mayonnaise and mix filling again. If you find your mixture is now a bit too thin, utilize your additional yolks from your extra eggs, smash and mix them in. Taste test your mixture once more if you do since your additions may have diluted your deviled egg flavor..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Garnish with additional fresh green chives, bacon bits and Paprika. Some even garnish with cooked salmon. Again, it&#39;s up to you! Be creative!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place egg tops on top of filling and garnish again lightly with Paprika..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Authors Note: You cannot freeze these for later use. However, they will keep in the fridge for three days..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Chill for an hour or longer and serve!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Tip: You can also slice the bottoms off of your traditional style Deviled Eggs [sliced in half] to keep them from sliding around your serving tray..
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

<p>
	
		The filling for this version is made simply with mayonnaise and a little mustard.
	
		Top these simple, basic deviled eggs with sliced grape tomatoes, snipped chives, or olive slices.
	
		We like them with slices of cornichons or diced.
